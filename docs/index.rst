Welcome to MNn's documentation!
===============================

Miyamoto-Nagai negative model :
-------------------------------

``MNn`` is a MIT-licensed Python package. Its main purpose is to model galaxies by providing a positive-definite potential-density pair expansion based on the Miyamoto-Nagai disc. This package functionality is two-fold :

   1. To provide analytical models to represent galaxy potentials and densities ...
   2. and to provide simple fitting interfaces to build the models from the data.     

This documentation serves as a guide and a reference. Feel free to send comments and remarks to the authors to help us improve the documentation and the package. The code is hosted on `github <https://github.com/mdelorme/MNn>`_.
